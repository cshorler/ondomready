onDOMReady
=====

#### A new solution to handle functional execution as soon as the DOM has loaded ####

The function utilizes several different platform-specific methods for detecting the readiness of the DOM all at once including; the DOMContentLoaded event, the document ready state, and Diego Perini's doScroll hack. Best of all, it does this without resorting to browser sniffing.
